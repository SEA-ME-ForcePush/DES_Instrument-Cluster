# What is cross compilation?
Cross-compilation is the process of compiling code on one computer system (called the host) to create executable code that runs on a different system (called the target).
This process is useful in embedded systems as the target device has limited resources and cannot host a compiler or development environment, such as microcontrollers or IoT devices
